I have used python language libraries do this assignment. Here I have provided some explanations about code that I have done.

List as a stack
I have used list data structure instead of stack data structure.
Explanation:
    a.append(): Adds an element to the end of the list, which is the 
      top of the stack.
    b.pop(): Removes and returns the last element of the list, which 
      is the top of the stack.
